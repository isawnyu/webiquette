# Webiquette

Wraps "requests" and "requests_cache" for automagical (but configurable) client-side caching, robots.txt compliance, and other good-citizen behavior for bots, scrapers, and scripts.

The `webiquette` package is written and maintained by [Tom Elliott](https://paregorios.org/about/) for the [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World](https://isaw.nyu.edu).
